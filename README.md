# Grammatical Tagging using Hidden Markov model 

The project aims to build a generic part of speech tagger for any given training data. 
A Hidden Markov model build from scratch in python has been used to learn the given data sets for part of speech tagging. 
The Hidden moarkov model designed in this project was tested on two datasets - Italian and Japanese. With an average accuracy of 95%.
